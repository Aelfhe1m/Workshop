  description = The OSE 3D Printing Lab is the logical next step to the 3D Printer prototype inside the Mobile Processing Lab and allows the in-situ creation of even larger parts. In addition it comes equipped with a recycling unit to recycle stored items back to MaterialKits with a conversion rate of 25%. This part comes in Orbital Kolonization Module form factor.
